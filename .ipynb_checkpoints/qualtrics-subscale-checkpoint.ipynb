Recall that over the next year the rate of return on the stock index fund will be +40% or -20%, with equal probability.  For the savings account, the rate of return is 5% for sure. What is the amount of money you expect to have at the end of this one year investment period?  \n",

Recall that over the next year the rate of return on the stock index fund will be +40% or -20%, with equal probability.  For the savings account, the rate of return is 5% for sure. What is the amount of money you expect to have at the end of this one year investment period?  \\\n",
